# Description

Visual saliency refers a part in a scene that captures our attention. Conventionally, many saliency detection techniques, including deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches, try to predict where people look without considering temporal information. However, temporal ordering of the fixations includes important cues about which part of the image may be more prominent. This project experiments with time weighted saliency maps or saliency volumes given the eye-fixations, ground truth saliency maps and images.
